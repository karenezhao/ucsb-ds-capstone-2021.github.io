### Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Datasets: R package
**Project Sponsor: National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)** \
**Mentors: Dr. Julien Brun, Dr. Allison Horst, Dr. Sang-Yun Oh** \
**Team Members: Sam Guo, Adhitya Logan, Lia Ran, Sophia Sternberg, Karen Zhao**

#### Goal
Build an R package and accompanying website that contains one sample dataset from each of the 28 Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network sites for use in data science education as an alternative to the popular but controversial [iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) dataset. 


#### Background Info
The [LTER network](https://lternet.edu/) is a set of 28 National Science Foundation-funded research programs to observe long-term and large scale ecological effects at various sites across the United States. LTER datasets are archived in a centralized data repository managed by the [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp). Our project sponsor, [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), is an environmental science research center at UC Santa Barbara that operates the LTER Network Office.


#### Software Tools
-  [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Github](https://github.com/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), [metajam](https://github.com/NCEAS/metajam), [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools)

#### Progress
- Continue to collaborate on the existing R package [`lterdatasets`](https://github.com/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021/lterdatasets) 
- Added our selected vignette with related files (documentation, code for processing raw data) to the package for xxx number of lter sites
- review each others help each other troubleshoot
- Present during meetings receive feedback mentors update
- coworking session to discuss website


#### Next steps
- Continue to explore datasets and create vignettes from the remaining xxx lter sites
- build website
